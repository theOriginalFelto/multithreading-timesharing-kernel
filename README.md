# Multithreading time-sharing kernel written in C++

A subsystem of a multithreaded operating system written in C++ with time sharing that is responsible for handling and managing threads. The code is to be compiled with the old Borland C/C++ compiler (bc31).
Detailed description of the project is available in Serbian inside the .pdf file.

The code is structured into directories:
- h: header files;
- src: source files;
- test: code that respresents a test program where multiple threads fire off keyboard events. The kernel is supposed to handle all those events.
Last but not least, there are two files that respresent a Scheduler: SHEDULE.H and APPLICAT.LIB .

This kernel is a project/assignemnt in Operating systems 1, which is a 2nd year course conducted in School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia.
